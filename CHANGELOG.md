## [1.1-SNAPSHOT] - 2024-08-22

> Artifact is available [here](https://github.com/smirnou/swiss-re-coffee-shop/actions/runs/10505310675)

### Added
- Implemented data persistence using a CSV file:
    - The CoffeeShop application now uses a CSV file to store and track orders from previous sessions.
    - This persistence ensures that the customerâ€™s cumulative purchase history is considered when applying bonuses, such as the "every 5th beverage is free" offer.

### Changed
- The bonus application system now checks the new persistent CSV file to accurately track and apply the 'Customer Stamp Card' bonus across sessions.

### Fixed
- Ensured that past orders are counted towards the 'Customer Stamp Card' promotion to accurately administer the free beverage offer on every fifth purchase, even across application restarts.

### Known Issues
- **Single User Limitation**: Currently, the persistence mechanism supports only one user's data (his orders).

## [1.0-SNAPSHOT] - 2024-08-21
