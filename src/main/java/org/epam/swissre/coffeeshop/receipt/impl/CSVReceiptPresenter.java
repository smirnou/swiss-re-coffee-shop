 *
 * <p>This presenter could be utilized in scenarios where receipts need to be output or saved in a structured
 * format that is compatible with spreadsheet applications and other CSV-compatible tools.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note: Actual implementation of CSV export functionality is not provided in this version
 * and would need to be implemented to meet specific application requirements.</p>
